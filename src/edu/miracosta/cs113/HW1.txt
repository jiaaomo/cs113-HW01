HW 1
How often do you get a solution in fewer than 20 guesses? Does this change depending on the theory you test (1, 2, 3)?
	Very often. Yes, because whenever solution = 1, it decrement the chance of weapon options, whenever solution = 2, it decrement 
	the chance of location options and whenever solution = 3, it decrement the chance of the person.

What is good or bad about this strategy?
  The good thing for this strategy is that it can keep tracking each element of weapon, location and murder from 6 to 1, 10 to 1 and 6 to 1, 
the result will accurate. The bad about this strategy is the time consumming
